Linker
======

A more versatile link shortener. This web app is currently in its beta-beta-beta...beta stage and is meant 
to be a proof of concept rather than a production ready app. 

It is currently hosted at the following link: http://linker-env-3mf2sndb4b.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Of course, if this app were to reach production, there would be a better, shorter domain name tied to the app. 

####Features
 - Can shorten one or more links under the same shortened URL
 - The user can customize the shortened URL
